# Projeto Batalha Naval (Naval Battleship) 
With the intent to apply the knowledges we were adquiring during the "Sistemas Embarcados" (Or-board Sistems) classes, my teacher proppouse that we made a Naval Battleship with a simple buttons circuit interface (applying debouncing using millis() and making State Machines interfaces in the code). So, this was my solution based on the initial conditions imposed.

## Paths
- BataNaval: here is the arduino code.
- Idea: here is the problem in Portuguese which we had to solve.
