# ProjetoFrequenciaCardiaca
   Trhough a simple Human Interface made with a Arduino and Heart Rate and O2 sensor (MAX30100 oximeter sensor), the projects capture the data from the patience and send it by Serial Port to an Excel Sheet, which makes all the visualization of  the data and also consolidate this informations sending it to the email of the  responsible doctor.
   Obs: Project made while I was in Mechatronics Technical High School, in 2020.
   ## Paths:
   - Arduino_Code: Presents the Arduino code with the logic of the human interface and communication with Excel via Serial Port
   -  Circuit: As suggests, the circuit builded.
   -  Execel_Sheets: The Excel interface which captures the signals and also send the e-mail when the user asks it



## Demonstrative (Portuguese). The video was made by me in 2020.
