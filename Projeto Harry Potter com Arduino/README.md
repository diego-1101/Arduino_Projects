# Harry Potter project with Arduino for exhibition at EXPOETE (Mogi Mirim) 
The Project was made in 2019 November for a presenting in an open ETEC fair called EXPOETE. 
Basically, the idea was to give the voluntaries the experience to be a wizard by saying spells and then it happening in front of them. For doing this, I've built a scenario where there was three lamps (one for the Lumus Maxima spell, other for the error message and the last for light when the buzzer tone), one fan covered with a cloth and also with an isopor ball on it (for the Wingardium Leviosa spell), a buzzer (to create songs), an infrared hidden circuit (for controlling when everything is going to happen) and, of course, a wand.
## Paths
- There is only one path, which is the Arduino Code used on the presentation.
